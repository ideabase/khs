# Craft Copy Plugin (beta)

This little command line tool helps to speed up common tasks around Craft CMS deployment on [fortrabbit](https://www.fortrabbit.com): 

* dump the database, 
* sync the assets folder, 
* push and pull code changes.

## Requirements

* MacOS or Linux (no Windows support so far) 
* Craft 3
* PHP 7.1
* Composer installed
* Executable binaries: `php`, `mysqldump`, `git` and `rsync` installed locally
* SSH key installed with fortrabbit (no password auth so far)

## Demo setup
